# InvestCalc

InvestCalc is a React-based investment calculator that allows users to input key details about their investment plansâ€”such as initial investment, annual contributions, expected return, and duration. The tool then calculates the investment's value over time, displaying the yearly growth, interest, and total invested capital.

## Features

- **User Inputs**:
  - **Initial Investment**: The starting amount invested.
  - **Annual Investment**: The amount added to the investment every year.
  - **Expected Return**: The expected annual return rate (in percentage).
  - **Duration**: The number of years you plan to invest.
- **Dynamic Calculation**:

  - Displays yearly data such as:
    - **Investment Value**: The value of the investment for each year.
    - **Interest (Year)**: The interest earned in that year.
    - **Total Interest**: The total interest earned over the investment period.
    - **Invested Capital**: The cumulative amount of capital contributed over time.

- **React State Management**:

  - Uses React's state and props to dynamically update the table of investment data each time the input changes.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Easy-to-understand inputs and automatic calculation on changes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **HTML**: For structuring the page content.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and making it responsive.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For implementing the core logic of investment calculations.

   - **Expected Return**: The expected annual return rate (e.g., 5% for a 5% return).
   - **Duration**: The number of years you will keep investing.
3. The app will display a table showing:
   - **Year**: The year of the investment.
   - **Investment Value**: The value of the investment at the end of that year.
   - **Interest (Year)**: The interest earned for that year.
